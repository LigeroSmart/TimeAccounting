  one Primary function und serveral extensions

  16:00 - 24:00 is not possible
  16:00 - 23:59 is possible

- grep the TimeAccountingmodule for record and replace the words with accounting or account
- sysconfig: allow to deactivate the option MaxIncompleteWorkingDays
- insert a config, that nobody kann insert the hole das misc!!!
- insert a config, that nobady kann insert misc without a description
- insert a config option that each new Project must match with the defined regexp for no 'InfoGenie'
- Kernel/System/TimeAccounting.pm sub UserSettingsInsert: create two separate functions for the
  db-insert in time_accounting_user and time_accounting_user_period. Maybe the update function too.
